This application uses 'mtcars' dataset and model the oucome Miles/gallon (MPG) against Displacement and Horse Power using Random Forest Method.

User can input values for displacement and horse power to get the predicted value for MPG.

It plots MPG on y-axis, diplacement on x-axis and insert second predictor horse power through colour. 
It also plots the point for the inserted input values and their corresponding output.

Input:
	location: side panel
	type    : slider
	input 1 : Horse Power
	input 2 : Diplacement

Output:
	location: main panel
	output  : predicted MPG value
